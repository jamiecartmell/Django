The Django Recruiter & Applicant Application is a web-based platform designed to streamline the recruitment process for both recruiters and job applicants. With a user-friendly interface, this application simplifies job posting, applicant tracking, and hiring decisions.

Recruiters can easily create job postings, manage applicants, and collaborate with team members to evaluate candidates. They can track the status of each applicant, schedule interviews, and communicate with potential hires directly through the platform.

Job seekers can browse through available job listings, submit their resumes, and track the status of their applications. They can also receive notifications about new job openings and updates on their application status.

Built on Django, a high-level Python web framework, this application ensures robust security features and scalability. It provides a seamless experience for recruiters and applicants alike, optimizing the recruitment process and enhancing the overall efficiency of hiring operations.
